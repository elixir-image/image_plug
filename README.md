# Image Plug

A Plug that interprets image URLs and applies appropriate transforms before streaming the image to the client. 

## Replacement Library

Note that this library is now being developed by @hlindset in the repository https://github.com/hlindset/image_plug

It will move into this organization when it is closer to public use status.
